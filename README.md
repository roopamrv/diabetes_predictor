App to predict diabetes

This model deals with prediction of Diabetes disease by performing an analysis of supervised learning models which are Logistic Regression Algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier.

Uploaded dataset from kaggle.

The major goal of this blog is to achieve the best accuracy so that we can predict the People who are affected by diabetes and may help them reduce risk by immediately consulting to doctor.

This model with 83.77% accuracy is ready considering Logistic Regression Algorithm.

WHY

There are several reasons which made me choose Diabetes Prediction as my Project for application.

Firstly, We are not aware of the fact that Diabetes being a very common disease has been taken lightly among people which is not the case at all.

Secondly, there are rapidly increasing cases of Diabetes now a days, reason being stress due to which it is now spreading among children of our age.

Furthermore, I always thought of creating awareness in people regarging the seriousness behind this ail. I hope with this small start I can make something which can help me in achieving my aim.

Contribution

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, learned about it and then implemented.

Checked the accuracy with all the possible classifiers and then made the model accurate.

Challenges

Researched about the relationship between all the features present in the dataset

Taking output of the model in a file

Googled how to deploy in a web application

Procedure to build the application through free hosting app HEROKU

When the model is built then we need to dump the file in pickle so that we can use picke output file in app.py for linking it with the UI and helping in creation of the web page.

Create a free account in heroku

On dashboard select create new app

Link it with gibhub repository and add necessary files, to check click here to see my repository which have all the necessary files.

Select Connect to GitHub one the connection is established then you can go ahead with manual deployement

Click on Deploy. You can check here steps to deploy using heroku.

For deployement we need Procfile as well as requirements.txt file for heroku, which is present in the link to my github repository.
